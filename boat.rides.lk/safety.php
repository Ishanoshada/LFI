<p>Jet skiing is incredibly fun… that's unless someone gets hurt. We don’t want anyone to urge hurt on the water, which is why we give all of our riders a full crash program in jet skiing before heading out on the open water. No experience is required to ride our jet skis, but you are doing got to pay close attention to our safety guidelines!</p>
	<p>Here’s a sample of the guidelines we’ll talk about before you begin your jet ski adventure. </p>		
	
	<p><b>Always wear a life jacket.</b> <br>We’ve got a ton of them, and we make sure that all of our jet skiers ton a life jacket before they jet away. We’ll also make sure that it’s strapped on tight and fits you properly, as life jackets that are too big or too small won’t work as effectively.</p>
	
	<p><b>Keep your distance from nearby jet skis and other watercraft.</b> <br>Keeping a secure distance from your fellow jet skiers, also as all other watercraft, gives you adequate time to prevent within the case of emergency and avoid a collision. Avoid jumping, splashing, and passing close to any other vessels.</p>
	
	<p><b>Stay alert and aware of your surroundings.</b><br>Continuously scope out every direction for nearby swimmers, jet skiers, boats, and other vessels. don't get visual impairment ! Tunnel Vision is once you only see what's directly ahead of you and you become unaware of what could also be next to you or behind you. Always look altogether directions to stop any accidents.</p>
	
	<p><b>Check your speed. </b> <br>Maintain a slow speed until you’re within the open water and faraway from shore. Always operate at a secure speed and be prepared to hamper or stop within the case of an emergency. You control the speed that you simply are comfortable with. If you would like to only cruise at half speed, that's totally ok. Once you're comfortable you'll speed up but as long as you would like to.</p>
	
	<p><b>Never drink and drive.</b> <br>Drinking while boating or jet skiing might not seem as serious as drinking while driving a car, but alcohol consumption is really one among the leading causes of sailing and jet ski accidents. even as it does during a car, drinking impairs your judgment behind the wheel of a ship or jet ski, which is why every state has laws against BUI. albeit you don’t find yourself in an accident, Boating Under the Influence can have serious legal consequences.</p>
	
	<p><b>We have your back.</b> <br>Our highly trained jet ski guides are going to be on the water with you for the duration of your jet ski rental. they're there to assist keep you and therefore the other customers safe and to assist answer any questions you'll have.</p>
	
	<p><i>Don’t let our safety rules and regulations intimidate you; again, we’ll offer you a crash program before you sit down on the Jet Ski. As long as you follow the security guidelines and use sense on the water, you’ll make certain to possess an incredible time.</i></p>
