# 🛡️ LFI Vulnerability Examples Repository

Welcome to the LFI Vulnerability Examples repository! This comprehensive guide will provide you with everything you need to understand, explore, and mitigate Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities in web applications. Whether you're a cybersecurity enthusiast, a web developer, or simply curious about web security, this repository is your ultimate resource.

## 🚀 Dive into the World of LFI Vulnerabilities

Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a critical security vulnerability that occurs when a web application improperly includes files on a server through the web browser. This oversight can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive files, execution of malicious code, and compromise of the entire web application.

## 🎯 What's Inside?

1. **Example Vulnerable Code**: Get hands-on experience with real-world vulnerable PHP code, showcasing how LFI vulnerabilities can be exploited.

2. **Mitigation Strategies**: Learn best practices for mitigating LFI vulnerabilities, including input validation, whitelisting, and secure coding practices.

3. **Advanced LFI Methods**: Explore advanced techniques used by attackers to exploit LFI vulnerabilities, such as directory traversal and PHP wrapper manipulation.

4. **Example Usage**: Test your skills by using example URLs to exploit LFI vulnerabilities in simulated web applications.

5. **Vulnerable Websites**: Explore real websites with LFI vulnerabilities, along with example URLs for testing and learning purposes.

## 🛠️ Example Vulnerable Code

```php
<?php
$file = $_GET['file'];
header("Cache-Control: public");
header("Content-Description: File Transfer");
header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=$file");
readfile($file);
?>
```

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

Implement robust mitigation strategies to safeguard your web applications against LFI vulnerabilities:

- Validate and sanitize user input rigorously.
- Whitelist allowed file paths to restrict access.
- Utilize file system permissions and access controls.
- Implement Content Security Policies (CSP) to mitigate risks.

## 🔍 Advanced LFI Methods

Discover advanced techniques employed by attackers to exploit LFI vulnerabilities:

1. **Directory Traversal**: Navigate through file systems to access sensitive files.
2. **Null Byte Injection**: Bypass file extension checks using null byte injections.
3. **PHP Wrapper Manipulation**: Exploit PHP wrappers to include remote files or execute arbitrary code.

## 🚀 Example Usage

Explore LFI vulnerabilities in action:

```
http://example.com/download.php?file=down.php
```

## 🌐 Vulnerable Websites

Discover real-world websites with LFI vulnerabilities for testing and learning:

```
    \.com
    \.com
    \.com

```
